# üìÑ Documentation Issue

Maintaining comprehensive, accurate, and accessible documentation is critical to the usability and sustainability of **BioView**. If you've encountered documentation gaps or inconsistencies, we welcome your help in identifying and reporting them.

## When to Open a Documentation Issue

Please consider opening a documentation-related issue if you notice any of the following:

### Missing Implementations in the [Docs Site](bioview.readthedocs.io)

Sections in the documentation website that are stubbed out, incomplete, or outdated relative to the codebase.

### Low or Absent Code Comments

Important code files, especially public APIs, utilities, or hardware backends, lack descriptive docstrings or inline comments.

### Outdated Examples or Tutorials

Any tutorial, usage guide, or example that no longer aligns with the current version of the project or dependencies.

### Lack of Localization or Translation

Pages on the documentation site are untranslated, or users are unable to switch to their preferred language.

### Broken Links or Navigation

Links that lead to non-existent anchors, redirect incorrectly, or return 404 errors.

### Formatting or Accessibility Issues

Markdown or HTML rendering issues that affect readability, as well as accessibility concerns (e.g., poor color contrast, lack of alt text).
