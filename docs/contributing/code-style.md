# ðŸ§± Code Style and Architecture

The BioView codebase is structured with clarity and modularity in mind. We follow a broad **Modelâ€“Viewâ€“Controller (MVC)** paradigm to ensure separation of concerns and hardware-independence.

## Project Structure

```bash
bioview/
â”œâ”€â”€ app.py              # Main entry point 
â”œâ”€â”€ device/             # Backend 
    â”œâ”€â”€ common/             # Shared helpers and common tooling
    â”œâ”€â”€ <device_name>/      # Device-specific implementation
â”œâ”€â”€ constants/          # Application-wide constants
â”œâ”€â”€ types/              # Data models and type definitions
â”œâ”€â”€ ui/                 # Frontend
â””â”€â”€ utils/              # General-purpose utilities
```

## Architectural Philosophy

### Types and Data Models

All generic data structures (e.g., `Device`, `Configuration`, etc.) should be defined in the `types/` directory. This allows clean reuse across the app.

### Domain-Specific Implementations

Specific functionality (e.g., USRP-specific subclasses) should be implemented in their respective module folders (e.g., `usrp/`, `biopac/`). This keeps generic definitions clean and backend-specific logic isolated.

### MVC Paradigm

Broadly speaking, BioView aligns with the [MVC architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller). The base implementation is structured as follows -

* **Model**: Device specific backends (such as for USRP, BIOPAC, etc) with a common API in  `device/`
* **View**: GUI components in the `ui/` directory
* **Controller**: `app.py` as a fairly non-opinionated controller

We implement this structure to encourage higher code quality and would urge you to stick with the same paradigm so that BioView remains - 

* Easy to extend for new hardware backends
* Maintainable and testable
* Decoupled between frontend (UI) and backend (hardware/control logic)

## Style Guidelines

* Follow [PEP8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) conventions unless explicitly overridden.
* Use type annotations and docstrings for all public functions and classes.
* Avoid placing business logic inside UI componentsâ€”keep the UI declarative and reactive.
* Organize code into appropriate modules as outlined above, and prefer modular, composable functions and classes.

### Pre-formatters

As the codebase scales, enforcing good coding practices becomes a challenge. We simplify this by making use of [`precommit`](https://pre-commit.com) which uses the following hooks to validate code before it gets committed -

* [`black`](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) is used for code formatting.
* [`flake8`](https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/) is used to enforce PEP8 compliance.
* [`isort`](https://pycqa.github.io/isort/) helps clean up messy import statements into a cohesive structure.

Please do not try to force through commits by skipping `pre-commit` checks as that will only make the codebase unmaintainable over time.
