# Installation

BioView should run on all platforms but is officially supported on the following platforms -

* **Windows**
* **Linux:** Ubuntu LTS, Debian, and derivative distributions.
  * Fedora and RHEL based distributions do not bundle in Python bindings for ```uhd``` and require manually buildng from source.
  * Non-LTS versions of Ubuntu are not supported due to missing packages.

## Dependencies

* **Python:** Ensure Python 3.12 is installed on your system. *For Windows, use the Microsoft Store app instead of the website executable.*
* **UHD:** You can install it by following the [official instructions](https://files.ettus.com/manual/page_install.html) for your operating system.
* **UHD Python Bindings (Linux users only):** For Ubuntu/Debian users, python bindings are installed using ```sudo apt install python3-uhd```. For RHEL/Fedora users, these need to be manually generated by building from source.

Once all the dependencies are installed, installing BioView is as simple as running ```pip install bioview```. We recommend running this command in a virtual environment so as to not pollute your operating system Python.
